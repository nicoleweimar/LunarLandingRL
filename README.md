# LunarLandingRL
This project trains a reinforcement learning agent to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to teach the agent to land a lunar module safely on a landing pad by learning from reward-based feedback through trial and error. The notebook walks through environment setup, training using a neural network-based policy, and evaluation of the agentâ€™s performance. Key reinforcement learning concepts such as policy learning, exploration vs. exploitation, and state-action value estimation are demonstrated. This project was completed as part of the ACM AI Research Track, where I was assisted and mentored throughout the process. The notebook also includes visualizations and handles compatibility issues like the deprecated numpy.bool8 error to ensure smooth execution.
